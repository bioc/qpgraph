## Installation

This is the __development__ version of the R/Bioconductor package qpgraph. This version is unstable and should be used only to test new features. If you are looking for the __release__ version of this package please go to its package release landing page at [https://bioconductor.org/packages/qpgraph](https://bioconductor.org/packages/qpgraph) and follow the instructions there to install it.

If you were really looking for this development version, then to install it you need first to install the [development version of Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/useDevel) and then type the following line from the R shell:


```r
BiocManager::install("qpgraph", version = "devel")
```

Alternatively, you can install it from GitHub using the [remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes "remotes") package.

```r
install.packages("remotes")
library(remotes)
install_github("rcastelo/qpgraph")
```
