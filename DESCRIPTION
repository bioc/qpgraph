Title: Reverse engineering of molecular regulatory networks with qp-graphs
Version: 1.4.1
Author: R. Castelo and A. Roverato
Description: q-order partial correlation graphs, or qp-graphs for short, are
             undirected Gaussian graphical Markov models built from q-order
             partial correlations. They are useful for learning undirected
             graphical Gaussian Markov models from data sets where the number of
             random variables p exceeds the available sample size n as, for
             instance, in the case of microarray data where they can be employed
             to reverse engineer a molecular regulatory network.
